            <p>Coins were introduced as a method of payment around the 6th or 5th century BCE. The invention of coins is still shrouded in mystery: According to Herdotous (I, 94), coins were first minted by the Lydians, while Aristotle claims that the first coins were minted by Demodike of Kyrme, the wife of King Midas of Phrygia. Numismatists consider that the first coins were minted on the Greek island of Aegina, either by the local rulers or by king Pheidon of Argos.</p>

It also can be all too painfully obvious and emphatic, slashing the value of our assets before our eyes. I was not around for the hyperinflation in Germany following World War I, when people paid for bread and milk with suitcases full of paper money. As a member of the generation born on the eve of World War II, I can, however, recall another dramatic example of big-time inflation right here at home â€“ one involving not luggage, but radio and TV.</p>

The numbers and letter of the paper currency issued at the beginning were printed in old Mongolian script and it was created with the numeric values of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100. The 25, 50, and 100.</p>
